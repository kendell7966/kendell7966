## Kendell W Cottam - GitHub Projects

This is a compilation of code that I have been working on recently, as well as a demo of my VirtualLens 3D software (coming soon).
I am currently taking courses on Computer Vision and Deep Learning using Python at OpenCV University. There are many interesting projects that I have worked on and I am publishing them here to show examples of my code.
